The DK Hostmaster [EPP service specification][DKHMEPPSPEC] describes the use and contents of the files in more detail.

The file `epp.xsd` is just for easier test and validation as mentioned, it can be used together with [`xmllint`][xmllint]:

```bash
$ xmllint --schema epp.xsd your_file.xml
your_file.xml validates
```

It will then either omit an error message or the success message: `your_file.xml validates`.

- The clean up will be completed and announced as **3.0**, since the XSD as a stand-alone breaks support for older schema versions and `epp.xsd` will be the only entry-point to support the older schema versions

- EPP Service version 2.3.X
- **Warning!** This release includes a change to the standard XSD from [RFC:5730], aligning the values for the password type. It has not been possible to get the patch applied using the XML Schema feature: `redefine` or `overwrite`. When this succeeds this change will have to be rolled-back. The change has been applied so the schema file conforms with the schema file used at DK Hostmaster A/S.

- The DKHM Schema file has been updated to revision 2.1, the file does not contain any changes apart from the import, this file was created for a uniform communication in regard to revision numbers etc.
